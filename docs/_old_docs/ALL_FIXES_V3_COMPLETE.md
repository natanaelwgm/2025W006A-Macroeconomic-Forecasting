# 🎯 ALL FIXES APPLIED - Dashboard V3

## ✅ Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **Target Variable Selection** ✅
**Problem:** Only 3 outcome vars appeared, couldn't choose which to analyze

**Solution:**
- Added **"Target Variables to Analyze"** section in Recipe_Config (rows 54-56)
- Auto-populates when data is loaded
- Check/uncheck which variables to forecast
- All variables checked by default
- Each variable can have custom horizons

**Location:** Recipe_Config rows 56+ (dynamically populated)

---

### 2. **Variable Limit Removed** ✅
**Problem:** Code limited backcast to only 5 variables (line 966)

**Solution:**
- Removed hardcoded `[:5]` limit
- Now processes ALL selected target variables
- No artificial restrictions

**Changed:** Line 1078 - now loops through all `selected_targets`

---

### 3. **Frequency Auto-Detection** ✅
**Problem:** Yearly data showed semesterly results, wrong test periods

**Solution:**
- Auto-detects data frequency from date column
- Sets appropriate default horizons:
  - Daily: `1,7,14,30`
  - Weekly: `1,4,12,24`
  - Monthly: `1,3,6,12`
  - Quarterly: `1,2,4,8`
  - Semesterly: `1,2,3,4`
  - Yearly: `1,2,3,5`
- Updates Recipe_Config automatically

**Location:** `load_data_from_recipe()` function, lines 673-696

---

### 4. **Frequency Moved to Recipe_Config** ✅
**Problem:** Data frequency was in Dashboard (confusing, wrong place)

**Solution:**
- Removed "Data Frequency" from Dashboard row
- Added to Recipe_Config (row 61)
- Auto-populated when data loads
- Part of forecast settings now

**Dashboard:** Row 8 now shows "💡 Set frequency in Recipe_Config"
**Recipe_Config:** Cell B61 contains frequency

---

### 5. **Charts Use Selected Models** ✅
**Problem:** refresh_charts used dummy models, not actual selections

**Solution:**
- Charts now train REAL models from config
- Uses same model implementations as backcast:
  - Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
  - RandomForest, GradientBoosting
  - Naive, SeasonalNaive, Drift
- Up to 10 models for speed

**Changed:** `refresh_recipe_charts()` function, lines 1502-1538

---

### 6. **Date-Based Splits in Charts** ✅
**Problem:** Charts used hardcoded 12 periods, not date-based splits

**Solution:**
- Charts now read train/test dates from Recipe_Config
- Uses same date filtering as backcast
- Consistent with repo format
- No hardcoded periods

**Changed:** `refresh_recipe_charts()` function, lines 1435-1462

---

## 📍 New Recipe_Config Layout

### Sections & Row Numbers:

| Section | Rows | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Recipe & Path** | 4-6 | Name, data path, dataset info |
| **Models** | 8-53 | 44 models checklist |
| **Targets** | 54-86 | Target variable selection (dynamic) |
| **Settings** | 59-67 | Frequency, horizons, train/test dates |
| **Hyperparameters** | E9-H40+ | Model hyperparameters |
| **Templates** | 69+ | Template grids |

### Key Cells:

```
B4  = Recipe Name
B5  = Data Path
B61 = Data Frequency (auto-detected)
B62 = Horizons
B63 = Train Start Date
B64 = Train End Date
B65 = Test Start Date
B66 = Test End Date
B67 = Date Column Name

A56+ = Target variable checkboxes (✓)
B56+ = Target variable names
C56+ = Target-specific horizons
```

---

## 🚀 New Workflow

### 1. Load Data
```
Click: [Load Real Data]
→ Auto-detects frequency
→ Auto-populates target variables
→ Sets default horizons based on frequency
```

### 2. Select Targets
```
Go to Recipe_Config rows 56+
→ Check/uncheck which variables to forecast
→ Customize horizons per variable if needed
```

### 3. Configure Settings
```
Recipe_Config:
→ Frequency (auto-set, can edit)
→ Train/test dates (rows 63-66)
→ Horizons (row 62, or per-variable in row 56+)
```

### 4. Select Models
```
Recipe_Config rows 10-53:
→ Check which models to test (44 available)
```

### 5. Run Analysis
```
[Run Backcast]
→ Uses selected targets only
→ Uses selected models only
→ Date-based train/test split
→ Appropriate test periods for frequency

[Refresh Charts]
→ Creates charts for selected targets
→ Uses real trained models
→ Date-based splits
→ Top N models per variable
```

## 📊 Frequency-Specific Settings

### Auto-Set When Data Loads:

| Frequency | Time Diff Detection | Default Horizons | Typical Use |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Daily | ≤ 7 days | 1,7,14,30 | Stock prices, daily rates |
| Weekly | ≤ 10 days | 1,4,12,24 | Weekly indicators |
| Monthly | ≤ 40 days | 1,3,6,12 | Most macro data |
| Quarterly | ≤ 120 days | 1,2,4,8 | GDP, quarterly reports |
| Semesterly | ≤ 210 days | 1,2,3,4 | Semi-annual data |
| Yearly | > 210 days | 1,2,3,5 | Annual indicators |

**Example:** Load yearly data → Auto-sets:
- Frequency: "Yearly"
- Default horizons: "1,2,3,5"
- Each target gets these horizons (editable)
