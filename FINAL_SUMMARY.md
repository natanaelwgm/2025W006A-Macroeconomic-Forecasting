# Indonesia Macroeconomic Forecasting - Final Results Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements comprehensive macroeconomic forecasting for Indonesia using multiple machine learning models across three frequencies: Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly.

## Final Results Structure

### 1. MONTHLY FORECASTING
- **Recipe**: `FINAL_RECIPES/recipe_monthly_final.json`
- **Output Directory**: `FINAL_RESULTS/monthly/`
- **Targets**: 10 macroeconomic indicators
- **Training Period**: 2005-01-01 to 2019-12-31
- **Test Period**: 2020-01-01 to 2025-07-31
- **Models**: 30+ models including AR1, Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, BVAR, LSTM, MIDAS, GARCH, ARIMA, DNS, TVP, NeuroGARCH, Tree-based models, DFM, PLS1, Huber, StandardizedLinear, StandardizedRidge, Naive, SeasonalNaive
- **Features**: Target lags [1,2,4], exogenous variables with lags [0,1,2], normalization methods, feature selection
- **Excel Reports**: 
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/Boss_Report_Monthly.xlsx` (Summary for boss)
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/forecasting_results_Monthly_detailed.xlsx` (Detailed results)

### 2. QUARTERLY FORECASTING
- **Recipe**: `FINAL_RECIPES/recipe_quarterly_final.json`
- **Output Directory**: `FINAL_RESULTS/quarterly/`
- **Targets**: 11 macroeconomic indicators (including informal employment)
- **Training Period**: 2005-01-01 to 2019-12-31
- **Test Period**: 2020-01-01 to 2025-07-31
- **Models**: Same comprehensive model set as monthly
- **Features**: Target lags [1,2,4], exogenous variables with lags [0,1,2], normalization methods, feature selection
- **Special Note**: Informal employment was forecast separately due to sparse data and then integrated into main results
- **Excel Reports**: 
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/Boss_Report_Quarterly.xlsx` (Summary for boss)
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/forecasting_results_Quarterly_detailed.xlsx` (Detailed results)

### 3. YEARLY FORECASTING
- **Recipe**: `FINAL_RECIPES/recipe_yearly_final.json`
- **Output Directory**: `FINAL_RESULTS/yearly/`
- **Targets**: 11 macroeconomic indicators
- **Training Period**: 2005-01-01 to 2019-12-31
- **Test Period**: 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31
- **Models**: Same comprehensive model set as monthly/quarterly
- **Features**: Target lags [1,2,3], exogenous variables with lags [0,1], normalization methods, feature selection
- **Excel Reports**: 
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/Boss_Report_Yearly.xlsx` (Summary for boss)
  - `FINAL_EXCEL_REPORTS/forecasting_results_Yearly_detailed.xlsx` (Detailed results)

## Target Variables (Consistent Across All Frequencies)
1. CPI (Consumer Price Index)
2. Real GDP Growth
3. FX (USD/IDR Exchange Rate)
4. BI7DRR (BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate)
5. Deposit Rate 1M (1-Month Deposit Rate)
6. Deposit Rate 3M (3-Month Deposit Rate)
7. Deposit Rate 6M (6-Month Deposit Rate)
8. Deposit Rate 12M (12-Month Deposit Rate)
9. Govt Bond Yield 10 Yr
10. JISDOR Exchange Rate
11. informal_employment

## Model Performance Summary
- **Monthly**: All 10 targets completed successfully
- **Quarterly**: All 11 targets completed successfully (including informal employment)
- **Yearly**: 10 out of 11 targets completed successfully (informal employment had insufficient data)

## Key Technical Achievements
1. **Multi-Frequency Analysis**: Consistent methodology across monthly, quarterly, and yearly frequencies
2. **Comprehensive Model Library**: 30+ different forecasting models tested
3. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Lag features, exogenous variables, normalization, feature selection
4. **Robust Data Handling**: Handled sparse data issues, missing values, and data quality challenges
5. **Professional Reporting**: Excel reports with detailed metrics, forecasts, and performance summaries
