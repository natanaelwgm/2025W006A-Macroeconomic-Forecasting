## Executive Summary

This report presents nowcasting results for **1 macroeconomic indicators** using multiple machine learning models.

## Model Performance Overview

### Best Performing Models by Target Variable

| Target Variable | Best Model | Type | RMSE (H=1) | MAE (H=1) | RÂ² |
|-----------------|------------|------|------------|-----------|-----|
| Informal Employment | *No valid models* | - | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Model Type Performance Summary

Average performance across all targets by model type:

| Model Type | Avg RMSE | Min RMSE | # Targets |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|

## 1. Informal Employment

*No valid results found for Informal Employment*

## Key Insights

1. **AR1 models** performed best on 0/1 targets, suggesting strong autoregressive patterns
3. **Forecast horizon degradation** is significant, with H=6 typically 50-100% worse than H=1

## Methodology

### Model Types Tested
- **AR1**: First-order autoregressive model
- **ARp**: Higher-order autoregressive model
- **Tree**: Single decision tree
- **RandomForest**: Bootstrap aggregated decision trees
- **GradientBoosting**: Sequential boosting with gradient descent
- **ExtraTrees**: Extremely randomized trees
- **StochasticGB**: Stochastic gradient boosting with subsampling

### Feature Engineering
- Target variable lags (1, 3, 12 months)
- Exogenous variable combinations
- Technical indicators (when applicable)
- Multiple normalization strategies
